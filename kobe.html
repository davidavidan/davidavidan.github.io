  <p>Kobe Bean Bryant (born August 23, 1978) is an American retired professional basketball player and businessman.[3] He played his entire 20-year career with the Los Angeles Lakers of the National Basketball Association (NBA). He entered the NBA directly from high school and won five NBA championships with the Lakers. Bryant is an 18-time All-Star, 15-time member of the All-NBA Team, and 12-time member of the All-Defensive team. He led the NBA in scoring during two seasons, and ranks third on both the league's all-time regular season scoring and all-time postseason scoring lists. He holds the NBA record for the most seasons playing with one franchise for an entire career.</p>
  <p>He is the NBA's 3rd all-time leading scorer. He once played along Shaquille O'Neal (which I wrote about on the next page), where they both won 3 championships together!</p>
  <h2 class="bryant">His Legendary Career</h2>
  <p>Kobe Bryant's career is mostly reflected off the all-time great Michael Jordan. Many of his shots are almost identical to Michael Jordan, like the post fadeaway, the aggression, the trash talking as well! Kobe and Michael are in my opinion, the two greatest NBA players of all time!</p>
